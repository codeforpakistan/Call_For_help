Suvidha
========

Suvidha is an android app that my team made in a hackathon organised by IBM. We made it in 4 days. We used IBM Bluemix for the backend services. 
To build it, you will need to get the new set of API keys from ibm bluemix (https://console.ng.bluemix.net/) and replace it in the local.properties file.

There are 3 main users for this application : Patient, Doctor and Hospital
The app Allows patients, doctors and hospitals to register in the app
  
USE CASES FOR PATIENTS :
-> Allows patients to search for doctors and hospitals near them or based on the ratings
-> Allows patients to take appointments from doctors
-> Allows patients to rate and leave a review for the doctors that they have visited
-> Update his profile
-> Allows a patient to avail the emergency service wherein the hospital nearest to the patients current location sends an ambulance over  
  
USE CASES FOR DOCTOR :
-> Allows a doctor to accept or reject an appointment
-> See his own rating and reviews
-> Update his profile
  
USE CASES FOR HOSPITALS :
-> Allows a hospital to add doctors to its hospital
